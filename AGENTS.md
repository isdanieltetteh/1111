ðŸš« Golden Rules

Do not modify backend logic.

All PHP, queries, and features already work.

Never remove, rename, or alter actions, buttons, forms, AJAX, or DB calls.

Do not invent database columns or tables.

Always reference schema.sql.

Only use what exists in the schema.

Do not change feature flows.

Every page already has the intended logic.

Only restyle the UI, never rewire how it works.

ðŸŽ¨ Allowed Tasks

âœ… Replace development UI with a modern, WOW-factor Bootstrap 5 design.
âœ… Use global templates (header.php, footer.php, theme.css) for consistency.
âœ… Add ad placeholders (banner, sidebar, inline, footer) for monetization.
âœ… Improve mobile responsiveness (faucet users are mainly mobile).
âœ… Add UI-level animations (scroll reveal, hover glow, card lift, badge shine).
âœ… Ensure multi-language readiness (do not hardcode text).

âš¡ Design Principles

Style inspiration: AdminLTE dashboards + Tailwind gradients + Glassmorphism + Animated UI patterns.

Pages must feel: trustworthy, monetizable, and premium.

Every page must reuse the same design system (cards, buttons, placeholders).

ðŸ“Œ Always Remember

Backend = sacred. Touch nothing in logic.

UI = flexible. Rebuild with modern responsive design.

Consistency = key. Same theme, same placeholders, same animations across all pages.
